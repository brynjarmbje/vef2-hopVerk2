# Next.js Project

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It's configured to run with a backend whose database is hosted on Render, which may take a while to start due to cold starts.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you are using Bun:
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result. The application interfaces with a backend, so ensure that your backend service is running or accessible if you are working locally.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel. You can view the deployed application here:
https://vef2-hopverk2.vercel.app/

## Features

Frontend: Built with Next.js, the frontend serves as the interface for users.
Backend Connection: Connects to a backend hosted on Render.

Our backend's database is hosted on render so it might take a while to cold start .
